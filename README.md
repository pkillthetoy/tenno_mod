Tenno class mod for Slay the Spire

Work in progress. 

Cards and Relics: Done!

Graphics progress:

* Relics: DONE
* Cards: 12/78
* Powers: 0/??
* Other: 
    * Idle/Dead graphic: SKIPPED
    * Campfire Shoulder view: DONE
    * Card backgrounds (0/3)
    * Energy Orb (0/1)

Progress will be slow. The current plan is:

* Relics will be done by hand.
* Cards will use in-game screenshots (Captura or Warframe mod images)
* The idle graphic and shoulder view will use Captura shots.
* Card backgrounds will be simple color edits - likely the colorless card
background with yellow trim.
* Energy Orb will be a recoloring of base-game orbs, but with the outline
changed to resemble an Orokin Ducat.
